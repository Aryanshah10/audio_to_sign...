	According to the World Health Organization(WHO) in 2021, there are over 1.5 billion people around the world (nearly 20% of the global population) who live with hearing loss. They often face challenges in understanding individuals without hearing loss.
	<br><br>
	Hearing loss is a common but often overlooked disability affecting millions of people worldwide. It is a condition that disrupts the ability to perceive sounds fully or partially, creating communication barriers and impacting the overall quality of life for those affected.
	<br><br>
	The inability to actively participate in social gatherings can lead to a sense of alienation. Many people with hearing loss avoid social events, fearing the embarrassment of misunderstanding conversations or constantly asking others to repeat themselves. Over time, this isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and detachment from the community.

	<p class="text2">Our project aims to break communication barriers and facilitate better interaction between individuas with hearing loss and the wider community.
<br><br>
The application uses speech to text to analyze the words and use the data given to it, to convert the text to Americal Sign Language(ASL). It is developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Our project can be implemented in news channels and public gatherings.</p>
